### AWS Amplify is a JavaScript library for frontend and mobile developers building cloud-enabled applications

AWS Amplify provides a declarative and easy-to-use interface across different categories of cloud operations. AWS Amplify goes well with any JavaScript based frontend workflow and React Native for mobile developers.

Our default implementation works with Amazon Web Services (AWS), but AWS Amplify is designed to be open and pluggable for any custom backend or service.

#### Visit our [Documentation site](https://docs.amplify.aws/) to learn more about AWS Amplify. Please see our [Amplify JavaScript](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/q/platform/js/) page within our Documentation site for information around the full list of features we support.

## Getting Started

AWS Amplify is available as `aws-amplify` package on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-amplify).

**Web**

If you are developing a JavaScript app, please visit our documentation site on [JavaScript](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/js).

**React**

If you are developing a [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/) app, please visit our documentation site on [React](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/react).

**Angular**

If you are developing an [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) app, please visit our documentation site on [Angular](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/angular).

**Vue**

If you are developing a [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) app, please visit our documentation site on [Vue](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/vue).

**React Native**

For React Native development, install `aws-amplify`:

```bash
$ npm install aws-amplify --save
```

If you are developing a [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) app, you can install an additional package `aws-amplify-react-native` containing [Higher Order Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html):

```bash
$ npm install aws-amplify-react-native --save
```

Visit our [Installation Guide for React Native](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/react-native) to start building your web app.

## Notice:

### Amplify 4.x.x has breaking changes for React Native. Please see the breaking changes below:

- If you are using React Native (vanilla or Expo), you will need to add the following React Native community dependencies:
  - `@react-native-community/netinfo`
  - `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`
  - `@react-native-picker/picker`

```
// React Native
yarn add aws-amplify amazon-cognito-identity-js @react-native-community/netinfo @react-native-async-storage/async-storage @react-native-picker/picker
npx pod-install

// Expo
yarn add aws-amplify @react-native-community/netinfo @react-native-async-storage/async-storage @react-native-picker/picker
```

### Amplify 3.x.x has breaking changes. Please see the breaking changes below:

- `AWS.credentials` and `AWS.config` donâ€™t exist anymore in Amplify JavaScript.
  - Both options will not be available to use in version 3. You will not be able to use and set your own credentials.
  - For more information on this change, please see the [AWS SDK for JavaScript v3](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/#configuration)
- `aws-sdk@2.x` has been removed from `Amplify@3.x.x` in favor of [version 3 of aws-sdk-js](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3). We recommend to migrate to [aws-sdk-js-v3](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3) if you rely on AWS services that are not supported by Amplify, since [aws-sdk-js-v3](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3) is imported modularly.

If you can't migrate to [aws-sdk-js-v3](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3) or rely on aws-sdk@2.x, you will need to import it separately.

- If you are using exported paths within your Amplify JS application, (e.g. `import from "@aws-amplify/analytics/lib/Analytics"`) this will now break and no longer will be supported. You will need to change to named imports:

  ```js
  import { Analytics } from 'aws-amplify';
  ```

- If you are using categories as `Amplify.<Category>`, this will no longer work and we recommend to import the category you are needing to use:

  ```js
  import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';
  ```
